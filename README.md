This repository is used to document the part of whole environment and procesess I created for efficient, automatic recruitment 
and handling of existing leads.

Here you will also find _**a lot of tools**_ that I created for recurring processes in the Shyftplan application,
which _**reduced our total working time from 160 hours a month to 16 hours a month.**_


## why it took 160 hours a month?

As as No. 1 Q-commerce in Poland we had near to half tousand physical workers, where 80% of them had changing/flexible schedule. 
For all of them, we had to prepare the appropriate number of shifts for over 30 places throughout Poland.
When we will add some variables like: worker status, possibility of using company equipment only for part of workers,
early access to schedule etc. then you get a complicated publication process that drags on for hours 
+
everything took place in an environment unsuitable for such a large scale operation (shyfplan).

90% of the activities in shyftplan were repetitive because of which I decided to automate it.

**For example:**
the process of re-clicking shifts from status A to status B 
(this process required a lot of concentration and was exhausting) 
took 1.5h/week + it was a repetitive process.

In response to the need, I decided to write a alogrithm with script that did it for us in 10minutes, 
which additionally ran in the background.


## quality of code
since my learning of programming started not so long ago (before that I mainly used no-code/low-code tools like Zapier),
therefore I made a classification of my tools into two categories:

1. scripts_first_steps
2. scripts_goodlooking

as the name suggests, the first folder contains my first steps in scripts writing. 
95% of them are non-objective and may resemble noodles, but they were my battleground for learning.

The second folder contains code that is already object-oriented and one that is easily expandable.
